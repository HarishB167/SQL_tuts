Section 1 : Getting Started

- What is SQL
? Database
is a collection of data stored in a format that can easibly be
accessed.
? DBMS are used to manage data
Database Management System
? 2 categories of DBMS
Relational : Tables linked to each other, using relationships.
SQL - Structured Query Language
Ex - MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
NoSQL : Don't have tables or relationships.
Don't understand SQL.

- Installing MySQL
? Create connection with local mysql as
Connection name : Local instance
Connection method : TCP/IP
Hostname : 127.0.0.1
Port : 3306
Username : root
Passwrod : <password>
Test the connection
? Restart mysql on Andronix
service mysql restart

- Creating the Databases
? Create database from script
? Each database has objects
Tables : where data is stored
Views : virtual tables (combine data from multiple tables
and put them in a view) (for creating reports)
Stored Procedures : Programs stored in database for querying data
Functions : Programs stored in database for querying data
? Every row in table is called record

Section 2 : Retrieving data from a single table

- The SELECT statement
? Using a database - USE <dbname>;
? SELECT <column names, > FROM <table name>;
? Selecting all columns : SELECT * FROM <table name>;
? Commenting : prepend statement with '-- '
? Order of clauses : Select, From, Where, Order By, Limit

- The SELECT Clause
? All Columns : SELECT * ...
? Some columns : SELECT col1, col2, ...
? With arithmetic operation
SELECT col1, (col2 + 10) * 100 ...
? Arithmetic operaitons : +, -, *, /, %
? With alias :
SELECT col1, col2 + 10 AS discount_factor ... ; 
SELECT col1, col2 + 10 AS 'Discount Factor' ... ;
? Getting unique result
SELECT DISTINCT col1 ...;

- The WHERE Clause
? For filtering data
? WHERE col1 > 3000;
? WHERE state = 'VA';
? Date values : WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01'
? Comparison operators : >, >=, <, <=, =, != or <>

- The And, Or, Not operators
? WHERE ... AND (... OR ...);
? WHERE ... OR ...;
? WHERE ... OR NOT ...
? WHERE NOT (... OR ...)

- The IN operator
? WHERE col1 IN (val1, val2, val3)
? WHERE col1 NOT IN (val1, val2, val3)

- The BETWEEN operator
? WHERE col1 BETWEEN val1 AND val3;
both values are inclusive.
? Can be used for date values. (YYYY-MM-DD)

- The LIKE operator
? Match a string pattern
? Case insensitive
? Old operator
? % - any number of chars.
? _ - any one character. : _y, b___y
? Starting with b : WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%';
? WHERE last_name LIKE '%b%';
? WHERE phone NOT LIKE '%9';

- The REGEXP operator
? Regular expressions
? Case insensitive
? field in name : WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field';
? ^ - beginning of string : ^field
? $ - end of string : field$
? | - or operator : field|mac
? ge/ie/me : '[gim]e'
? range : [a-h], [a-z] etc.

- The IS NULL operator
? WHERE col1 IS NULL
? WHERE col1 IS NOT NULL

- The ORDER BY Clause
? Sorting data in sql queries
? By default records are sorted by ID (it's primary key)
? SELECT * FROM table1 ORDER BY col1
? Descending : ORDER BY col1 DESC
? Multiple cols :
ORDER BY col1 DESC, col2
Main sort is of col1 then of col2.
? Can use expressions
ORDER BY col1 * col2 DESC
? In MySQL, columns not in select clause can be used in order by.
? Can sort by alias
SELECT col1, col2, col2+1 as alias FROM ...
ORDER BY alias
? Avoid sorting with column positions, and use column names.

- The LIMIT Clause
? Limiting no of records returned by query
? SELECT * FROM table1 LIMIT 3;
? Using offset 
Setting start of data
For pagination
SELECT * FROM table1 LIMIT <offset>, <records count>
SELECT * FROM table1 LIMIT 6, 3
? LIMIT clause always comes at end.
